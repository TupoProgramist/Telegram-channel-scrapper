# Telegram Opportunity Discovery System

> An AI-powered automation system that discovers, validates, and extracts academic opportunities from Telegram channels using intelligent content analysis.

## Motivation

This project was created to solve a personal challenge: efficiently tracking valuable academic and professional opportunities (grants, scholarships, internships) that are frequently shared across numerous Telegram channels. Manually monitoring dozens of channels and distinguishing genuine opportunities from irrelevant content was time-consuming and inefficient. The system automates this process, allowing students and researchers to focus on applying for opportunities rather than searching for them.

## Key Features
- **Automated Channel Discovery**: Uses Telegram's recommendation API to find new opportunity-focused channels
- **AI-Powered Content Validation**: Integrates with OpenAI GPT models to classify channel relevance and filter out non-opportunity content
- **Intelligent Opportunity Extraction**: Analyzes and structures individual opportunities from validated channels into actionable data
- **Multi-API Integration**: Supports both OpenAI and Groq APIs for cost-effective AI analysis
- **Persistent Data Management**: SQLite database tracks channel metadata, validation status, and extracted opportunities

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Key Libraries:** Telethon (Telegram API), OpenAI, Groq, SQLAlchemy, BeautifulSoup, PyAutoGUI
- **APIs:** OpenAI GPT-3.5/GPT-4, Groq LLaMA, Telegram API
- **Database:** SQLite with structured schema for channels and opportunities
- **Automation:** UI automation and API-based channel interaction

## Overview

A comprehensive Python-based system designed to automate the discovery and analysis of academic and professional opportunities (grants, scholarships, internships, research positions) from Telegram channels. This project addresses the challenge of manually tracking numerous Telegram channels that post valuable opportunities for students, researchers, and young professionals.

## Project Motivation

**Problem Statement**: Many valuable opportunities for students and researchers are shared through Telegram channels, but:

### Key Algorithms

#### Channel Relevance Scoring
The AI validation system uses carefully crafted prompts to assess whether a channel contains:
- Academic opportunities (scholarships, research positions)
- Professional development (internships, training programs)  
- Funding opportunities (grants, competitions)
- Educational resources (courses, workshops)

#### Recommendation Network Traversal
The system leverages Telegram's built-in recommendation algorithm to discover new channels by:
1. Starting with known relevant channels (seed set)
2. Fetching recommendations for each seed channel
3. Recursively exploring recommendations to build a comprehensive network

## Development Evolution

children = telegram.get_children(client, '@education_opportunities')

# Validate each discovered channel
for child in children:
    posts = telegram.fetch_first_5_posts(client, child.username)
    is_relevant = AI.validate_channel(posts)
```

### AI-Powered Channel Validation
```python
# Analyze channel content for relevance
def validate_channel(posts):
    combined_content = "\n".join(posts)
    prompt = f"Analyze if this content relates to opportunities like grants, scholarships, internships: {combined_content}"
    return openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
